📅 Project Planning: Student Grade Prediction
🎯 Project Goal:
Predict student grades based on their study time using regression techniques and visualize the relationship between study habits and academic performance.

🗂️ Project Phases
1. Problem Understanding & Goal Definition
Define the objective: Predict grades using study time.

Identify input (study time) and output (grades).

Set evaluation metrics: MAE and R² score.

2. Data Collection & Loading
Load dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.

Inspect the structure and content using pandas.

3. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing or incorrect data (if any).

Convert data types if needed.

Normalize or scale values if necessary (optional in this case).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize data distributions:

Box Plots for outliers

Histograms for frequency

Scatter Plots with Regression Line to assess correlation

Analyze the relationship between study time and grades.

5. Model Building
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

6. Model Evaluation
Use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score to assess accuracy.

Interpret the results and determine model usefulness.

7. Visualization & Interpretation
Plot the regression line over scatter plot.

Present findings clearly using visual tools.

8. Documentation & Review
Summarize the process, results, and lessons learned.

Create README, review report, or LinkedIn post.

⏱️ Timeline Example (Adjust as needed)
Phase	Duration
Problem Definition & Setup	0.5 day
Data Preprocessing & EDA	1 day
Model Building & Evaluation	1 day
Visualization & Reporting	0.5 day

🛠️ Future Improvements
Add more features (e.g., sleep time, test anxiety level)

Test multiple regression models (Ridge, SVR)

Apply cross-validation for better performance evaluation
