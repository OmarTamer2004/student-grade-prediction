🔍 Project Review: Student Grade Prediction



📌 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts a student’s academic grade based on the number of hours they study, aiming to uncover the relationship between study time and academic performance.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for regression modeling and evaluation

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Cleaned and analyzed the dataset

Created Box Plots, Histograms, and Scatter Plots with Regression Lines to visualize distributions and relationships

Detected and handled outliers and missing values

🧠 Modeling Approach
Applied Linear Regression to predict student grades

Evaluated model performance using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

✅ Results
The model was able to capture a clear positive correlation between study time and student performance

Achieved an interpretable and explainable model useful for educational insights

🎯 What I Learned
Practical implementation of regression techniques in a real-world context

The importance of data visualization in understanding data trends

How to evaluate and tune predictive models using key regression metrics

Gained hands-on experience in translating raw data into actionable insights

🙌 Conclusion
This project gave me a strong start to my internship at Elevvo, allowing me to apply machine learning to solve a real-world problem. It enhanced my technical and analytical skills and reinforced my passion for data science.
